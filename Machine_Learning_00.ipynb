But for the most part, we just did not know how to write an explicit program to do many of the more interesting things, such as perform web search, recognize human speech, diagnose diseases from X-rays or build a self-driving car. The only way we knew how to do these things was to have a machine learn to do it by itself"

This is sometimes called Artificial General Intelligence or AGI. I think AGI has been overhyped and we're still a long way away from that goal. I don't know. It'll take 50 years or 500 years or longer to get there. But mostly AI researchers believe that the best way to get closer toward that goal is by using learning algorithms."
