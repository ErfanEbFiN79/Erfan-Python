It'll take 50 years or 500 years or longer to get there. But mostly AI researchers believe that the best way to get closer toward that goal is by using learning algorithms."

Say you're building a machine learning system so that doctors can have a diagnostic tool to detect breast cancer. This is important because early detection could potentially save a patient's life.Using a patient's medical records your machine learning system tries to figure out if a tumor that is a lump is malignant meaning cancerous or dangerous. Or if that tumor, that lump is benign, meaning that it's just a lump that isn't cancerous and isn't that dangerous? Some of my friends have actually been working on this specific problem. So maybe your dataset has tumors of various sizes. And these tumors are labeled as either benign, which I will designate in this example with a 0 or malignant, which will designate in this example with a 1. You can then plot your data on a graph like this where the horizontal axis represents the size of the tumor and the vertical axis takes on only two values 0 or 1 depending on whether the tumor is benign, 0 or malignant 1. One reason that this is different from regression is that we're trying to predict only a small number of possible outputs or categories.\n",
